TermPlanning
============

This is my first program in C++. It's a simple program to create a task list (planning) in the terminal.
The data is stored in a JSON file.

Upcoming features:
* Log - See what you have done.


.bashrc 
============
TermPlanning is intended to be executed when starting your favorite shell. So every time you start your shell, you see your list of tasks.

Editor mode (beta)
============
Editor mode is the mode used to edit the tasks. This mode uses an ncurses interface in the terminal.
